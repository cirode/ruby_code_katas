= Ruby Code Katas
A set of small code Katas in Ruby to show how I would approach certain problems. It will be interesting to come back to each problem after a period of time and see how my implementations change.

Each code Kata is meant to solve the problem at hand and does not necessarily show the best implementation in all situations. This is actually a good simulation of a real world project: Not all requirements are known up front, so a maintainable and extensible solution to the known requirements is a good starting point.
